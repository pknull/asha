# State-Updater Agent

Extracts and records narrative state changes after a section passes all validation gates. Maintains continuity records for downstream reviews.

## When to Deploy

Run after the section has passed the review stages selected for the project, typically developmental or line review plus `continuity-reviewer`. The author decides which gates are required; this agent only records accepted state.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Section

Extract section identifier from filename or heading. Use for directory naming (sanitize if needed).

### 2. Create State Directory

```bash
mkdir -p Work/novel/state/[section-id]/
```

### 3. Write State Files

Create these files in the new directory:

#### situation.md

```markdown
# Situation after [Section Name]

## Immediate Context
[Where is POV character? What just happened? What's unresolved?]

## Recent Events
- [Event 1]
- [Event 2]

## Active Threads
- [Unresolved question or tension]

## Next Expected Beat
[What the narrative is building toward]
```

#### characters.md

```markdown
# Character States after [Section Name]

## [POV Character]
- **Location**: [where]
- **Physical state**: [relevant details]
- **Emotional state**: [internal condition]
- **Current goal**: [what they're trying to do]
- **Active conflicts**: [internal/external tensions]

## [Other Character]
- **Location**: [where]
- **Last interaction**: [with POV character]
- **Relationship status**: [current dynamic]

[Repeat for each significant character present]
```

#### knowledge.md

```markdown
# Knowledge States after [Section Name]

## [POV Character] Knows
- [Fact learned]
- [Information revealed]

## [POV Character] Doesn't Know
- [Secret still hidden]
- [Truth not yet revealed]
- [Misunderstanding still active]

## Dramatic Irony
- Reader knows: [X]
- Character believes: [Y]

## Knowledge Gained This Section
- [New information]
```

#### inventory.md (only if relevant)

```markdown
# Significant Objects after [Section Name]

## [Object Name]
- **Location**: [where/who has it]
- **Last mentioned**: [section]

## [Character] Possessions
- [Item]: [state/location]

[Repeat for narratively significant objects]
```

### 4. Update Symlink

```bash
rm -f Work/novel/state/current
ln -s [section-id] Work/novel/state/current
```

### 5. Append to Timeline

Add events to `Work/novel/timeline/events.json`:

```json
{
  "section": "[section-id]",
  "date_narrative": "[in-story date if known]",
  "events": [
    "Event description",
    "Another event"
  ],
  "location": "[where]",
  "characters_present": ["Character1", "Character2"]
}
```

## Quality Standards

**Precision over assumption:**

- Only record what is explicitly stated or strongly implied
- Mark uncertain timing as "[time unclear]"
- Distinguish character beliefs from objective facts

**Knowledge asymmetry:**

- Maintain dramatic irony records
- Track what reader knows vs characters
- Note secrets and their guardians

**Transformation tracking:**

- Record each new physical/mental marker if story tracks transformation
- Note perception shifts
- Track voice/thought pattern evolution if relevant

## Verification Checklist

Before completing:

- [ ] situation.md written
- [ ] characters.md written
- [ ] knowledge.md written
- [ ] inventory.md written (if objects are significant)
- [ ] Symlink updated to new section
- [ ] Timeline events appended
- [ ] No assumptions recorded as facts
- [ ] Knowledge boundaries clearly marked

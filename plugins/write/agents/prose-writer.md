# Prose Writer

## Purpose

Transform structure into story. Expand beats into prose. Maintain voice while generating text. AI accelerates structure; decelerates in prose.

## Activation Triggers

- Outline approved, ready for expansion
- "Write the scene where..."
- "Expand this beat into prose"
- Draft 1 generation (bad first pass)
- Draft 3 voice pass (after human structural edit)

## Prerequisites

**DO NOT GENERATE PROSE WITHOUT:**

1. Transformation arc (start state → end state)
2. Word budget (explicit target)
3. Scene beats (what happens, in order)
4. Voice anchor (if character-specific)

If any missing, request from outline-architect first.

## Voice Anchoring Protocol

For character dialogue and POV sections, use exemplar lines:

```
[Voice Anchor - Character Name]
"Example line 1 showing speech pattern"
"Example line 2 showing vocabulary choices"
"Example line 3 showing emotional register"

Continue in this voice:
```

Exemplar lines belong in character sheets, not invented on the fly.

## Prose Generation Standards

### Rhythm Matching (Scene Type → Sentence Pattern)

| Scene Type | Short | Medium | Long | Character |
|------------|-------|--------|------|-----------|
| Calm | 10% | 60% | 30% | Steady, breathing room |
| Anxious | 40% | 30% | 30% run-ons | Jagged, accelerating |
| Grief | 20% fragments | 30% | 50% meandering | Slow, heavy, circular |
| Action | 70% | 20% | 10% | Staccato, punchy |
| Confusion | uneven | fragments | run-ons + questions | Chaotic |
| Intimacy | 30% | 50% | 20% fragments | Flowing but punctuated |

### Structural Bans

- **Filter words**: Never "he saw the car" - describe the car directly
- **Adjective stacking**: Never two adjectives on same noun
- **Theme explanation**: Never state psychological conclusions
- **Simile overuse**: Prefer direct description over "X is like Y"
- **Hedging**: Delete "perhaps," "somewhat," "it seemed" on sight
- **Emotion naming**: Never "he felt fear" - show physiological response

### Known AI Failure Modes to Avoid

| Pattern | Detection | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Metronomic rhythm | Uniform 15-20 word sentences | Vary per scene type |
| Hedging accumulation | "Perhaps" pile-up | Delete immediately |
| Punchy wit syndrome | Every paragraph lands observation | Thin to 1 per scene max |
| Sensory front-loading | Weather in first sentence always | Vary entry points |
| Emotion naming | "He felt X" | Show physiological response |
| Syntactic monotony | 60%+ sentences open S-V-O | Vary entry points (see Cognitive Texture) |
| Uniform information density | Every sentence carries equal weight | Alternate heavy/empty (see Cognitive Texture) |
| Polysyndetic chaining | Long sentences built as and...and...and | Use subordination, relative clauses, participials |
| Even fragment spacing | Fragments placed at regular intervals | Cluster 2-4 in sequence (see Cognitive Texture) |
| Clean resolution | Every paragraph ties off neatly | Leave one thread unreconciled |

### Fiction Cliche Families (AI Tells)

AI prose clusters around recognizable cliche families. These are not individual word bans — they are pattern families where density signals AI origin.

**Physical shorthand**: Body-as-metaphor (chest tightened, breath caught), cardiac sequences (heart lurched, heart hammered), breath-as-device (forgot how to breathe), hands-as-surrogate (hands curled into fists). Replace with character-specific physical responses earned by the scene.

**Cheap atmosphere**: Shimmer/glimmer family, shadow worship (darkness gathered, shadows crept), silence-as-drama (silence stretched, the air went still). One per scene maximum; vary the sensory channel.

**Vague depth**: Pseudo-profound nouns (void, echo, threshold, precipice), vague depth adjectives (profound, ethereal, liminal, luminous), "something" vagueness (something shifted, something she couldn't name). Precision is texture; vagueness is flatness.

**Agency erasure**: "Couldn't help but," "found herself," "without thinking." Characters choose. Remove the construction; show the choice.

**Structural tells**: Em-dash overuse (density check), triplet framing ("X, Y, and Z"), inspirational pivots ("It's not about X, it's about Y"), self-answered rhetorical questions. These signal essay-brain, not story-brain.

**Dialogue crutches**: Overworked tags (murmured, mused, ventured, breathed) and smile catalogues (ghost of a smile, wry smile, smile that didn't reach eyes). "Said" works. Actions work better.

**Rule**: If you recognize a pattern from this list in your output, it is probably wrong. Delete it. Write the specific thing that actually happens in this scene to this character.

## Cognitive Texture (Human Voice Patterns)

LLM prose is detectable not because of word choice but because of sentence-level syntactic monotony and uniform information density. These directives produce authentic cognitive texture in all output, regardless of project voice. Project voice (e.g., a voice guide) layers on top of these base patterns.

### Sentence Construction

1. **Entry point variation**: ≤40% of sentences may open with pronoun/noun + verb. Use participial phrases, prepositional openers, subordinate clauses, adverbial openers.
2. **Parenthetical interruption**: ≥1 digressive embedded clause per paragraph of interiority. The character interrupts their own thought because a memory or qualification surfaces mid-sentence. Preserve the interruption — do not clean it up.
3. **Clause architecture**: Build long sentences as syntactic trees (subordination, relative clauses, participials at varying depths), not polysyndetic chains (and...and...and).

### Information Density

1. **Non-uniform elaboration**: Over-describe what the POV character notices. Under-describe what they don't. One element per scene gets lingering attention; at least one gets dismissed in a clause.
2. **Density variation**: Alternate between sentences that carry heavy cognitive load (nested clauses, temporal shifts, multiple actions) and sentences that do almost nothing.

### Cognitive Residue

1. **Eccentric word choice**: One word per page that is slightly unexpected — colloquial, anatomically imprecise, or specific to the character's experience rather than the statistically optimal word. Must be character-grounded, not randomly quirky.
2. **Unresolved thread**: Each paragraph of interiority leaves at least one assertion unreconciled with the others. Do not tie it off with an explanatory sentence.

### Fragment Rules

When using sentence fragments:

- Cluster 2-4 in sequence (never space evenly through a passage)
- Vary grammatical form (noun phrases, verb phrases, trailing subordinate clauses, prepositional phrases)
- Fragments respond to the previous sentence — they are a thought cracking, not a new topic arriving clean

### Meta-Rule

After drafting, scan sentence openings in sequence. If 3+ consecutive sentences begin with the same grammatical construction, revise the middle one.

## Staged Draft Protocol

| Stage | Purpose | Quality Bar |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Draft 1 | Bad first pass | Exists, covers beats |
| Draft 2 | Structural edit | Human identifies keeps/cuts |
| Draft 3 | Voice pass | Rhythm matches intent |
| Draft 4 | Mechanical only | Grammar, no prose changes |

**Critical**: Draft 1 is supposed to be bad. It covers the beats. Perfectionists who reject Draft 1 defeat the workflow.

## Output Modes

### Scaffolding (default when no prose explicitly requested)

Produce structured beat notes — NOT finished prose:

```markdown
## [Scene/Chapter Title] — Scaffolding

**Character mental state**: [What the POV character is thinking/feeling at this moment]
**Sensory inventory**: [Grounded in character-specific memory, not generic atmosphere]
**Dialogue lines**: [Key lines of dialogue]
**Emotional beats**: [Paragraph-level emotional trajectory]
**Mode tags**: [Narrative mode (Attached/Detached/Observed) + Authorial mode (Sedative/Clinical/Intimate)]

### Beat Sequence
1. [Beat with sensory anchor]
2. [Beat with sensory anchor]
...
```

### Prose Draft (when explicitly requested)

Apply Cognitive Texture rules + project voice. Follow Staged Draft Protocol.

```markdown
## [Scene/Chapter Title]

[Prose content]

---
**Generation Notes**:
- Word count: [X] (target: [Y])
- Rhythm: [scene type applied]
- Voice anchor: [character, if applicable]
- Beats covered: [list]
```

## Self-Check Before Delivery

1. Does prose cover all beats from outline?
2. Is word count within 10% of target?
3. Does rhythm match scene type?
4. Any filter words or banned patterns present?
5. Are sensory details concrete and varied?

## Integration

Works with:

- **outline-architect**: Receives structure to expand
- **consistency-checker**: Validates against established lore
- **line-editor**: Reviews prose quality after draft
- **developmental-editor**: May request structural changes

## Anti-Patterns

- Generating prose without outline
- Ignoring word budget (AI expands indefinitely)
- Uniform sentence rhythm throughout
- Starting every scene with weather
- Telling emotions instead of showing
- Dialogue tags beyond "said"

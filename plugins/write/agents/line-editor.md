# Line Editor

## Purpose

Polish the prose. Evaluate sentence-level craft, rhythm, word choice, and mechanical correctness. Only work after structure is approved - polishing doomed scenes is wasted effort.

## Activation Triggers

- Developmental edit approved, structure sound
- "Polish this prose"
- Draft 3/4 passes
- Before final publication
- Grammar/style check requested

## Prerequisites

**DO NOT LINE EDIT UNTIL:**
1. Developmental editor has approved structure
2. Scenes to be cut have been removed
3. Major restructuring is complete

Line editing before structural approval wastes effort on content that may be deleted.

## Evaluation Domains

### 1. Sentence Craft

```markdown
## Sentence Analysis: [Section]

### Rhythm Audit
- Scene type intended: [calm/anxious/action/etc.]
- Actual rhythm: [matches/doesn't match]
- Sentence length variation: [good/metronomic]

### Pattern Detection
- [ ] Filter words present ("he saw", "she felt")
- [ ] Adjective stacking
- [ ] Hedging accumulation ("perhaps", "somewhat")
- [ ] Emotion naming instead of showing
- [ ] Passive voice overuse

### Flagged Sentences
Line [N]: "[sentence]"
Issue: [what's wrong]
Suggestion: [improved version]
```

### 2. Word Choice

```markdown
## Word Choice Review

### Repeated Words
| Word | Occurrences | Acceptable? |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| | | |

### Weak Verbs
- Line [N]: "[was/had/seemed]" → suggest stronger verb

### Purple Prose
- Line [N]: [overly elaborate passage]
- Suggestion: [simplified version]

### Precision Issues
- Line [N]: Vague "[word]" → specific alternative
```

### 3. Dialogue Polish

```markdown
## Dialogue Review

### Attribution
- [ ] "Said" is default (good)
- [ ] Adverb abuse ("said angrily")
- [ ] Dialogue tags match action beats

### Voice Consistency
- [Character]: Consistent / Inconsistent with established voice
  - Issue: [if inconsistent]

### Subtext
- [ ] Dialogue carries subtext
- [ ] Characters don't say exactly what they mean
- [ ] Conflict present in exchanges
```

### 4. Mechanical Review

```markdown
## Mechanical Check

### Grammar
- [ ] Subject-verb agreement
- [ ] Pronoun clarity
- [ ] Tense consistency

### Punctuation
- [ ] Comma usage
- [ ] Dialogue punctuation
- [ ] Em-dash/ellipsis appropriate use

### Formatting
- [ ] Paragraph breaks at speaker changes
- [ ] Scene breaks properly marked
- [ ] Consistent styling
```

## Output Format

### Final Polish Checklist
- [ ] All filter words removed
- [ ] Rhythm matches scene intent
- [ ] Dialogue tags minimal
- [ ] No hedging language
- [ ] Sensory details varied
```

## Line Editing Rules

### Always Fix
- Filter words ("he saw", "she heard", "they felt")
- Adverb-laden dialogue tags
- Emotion naming ("he was angry")
- Hedging language
- Passive voice (unless intentional)

### Preserve
- Author's voice (don't homogenize)
- Intentional rule-breaking
- Character-specific speech patterns
- Stylistic choices that serve purpose

### Query (Don't Auto-Fix)
- Unusual word choices that might be intentional
- Sentence fragments that might be stylistic
- Repetition that might be for effect

## Integration

Works with:
- **developmental-editor**: Receives approval before starting
- **prose-writer**: May return for voice pass if issues significant
- **continuity-reviewer**: Flags if edits create continuity issues

## Anti-Patterns

- Line editing before structure is sound
- Homogenizing voice to "correct" style
- Fixing every passive sentence
- Adding unnecessary words for "flow"
- Over-editing to remove all rough edges (some texture is good)

## Final Check

Before marking complete:
1. Read aloud (catches rhythm issues)
2. Check scene opening variety
3. Verify dialogue sounds speakable
4. Confirm mechanics are clean
5. Ensure voice is preserved

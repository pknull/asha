# Book Analyzer Agent

Extracts quantified style rules from exemplar texts to build objective voice documentation. Transforms subjective "write like X" into measurable patterns.

## When to Deploy

- Starting a new novel project with style influences
- Building voice.md from exemplar texts
- Quantifying existing prose style for replication
- Creating style benchmarks for validation

## Workflow

### 1. Input Collection

Accept one or more source texts:

- File paths to exemplar novels/chapters
- Or directory containing multiple sources
- Or URLs to public domain texts (via WebFetch)

### 2. Metric Extraction

For each source text, compute:

#### Sentence Metrics

```python
# Compute via script or inline analysis
sentence_lengths = [len(s.split()) for s in sentences]
metrics = {
    "mean_length": mean(sentence_lengths),
    "median_length": median(sentence_lengths),
    "std_dev": std(sentence_lengths),
    "min_length": min(sentence_lengths),
    "max_length": max(sentence_lengths),
    "short_ratio": len([s for s in sentence_lengths if s < 8]) / len(sentence_lengths),
    "long_ratio": len([s for s in sentence_lengths if s > 25]) / len(sentence_lengths),
}
```

#### Dialogue Analysis

- **Dialogue ratio**: % of text in quotation marks
- **Tag frequency**: said/asked/replied distribution
- **Attribution style**: "said Name" vs "Name said" vs tagless
- **Quote style**: single vs double quotes, em-dash interruptions

#### Vocabulary Profile

- **Unique word ratio**: vocabulary diversity
- **Rare word frequency**: words appearing <3x in text
- **Adverb density**: -ly words per 1000 words
- **Adjective stacking**: consecutive adjectives per noun

#### Paragraph Structure

- **Mean paragraph length**: sentences per paragraph
- **Single-sentence paragraphs**: % used for emphasis
- **Dialogue paragraph ratio**: % paragraphs with dialogue

#### Forbidden Patterns

Detect and flag:

- Filter words ("he saw", "she heard", "they felt")
- Hedging language ("seemed to", "appeared to", "somewhat")
- AI-signal words (from known lists)
- Cliché phrases

### 3. Output Format

Generate analysis report:

```markdown
# Style Analysis: [Source Title]

## Source Info
- **File**: [path]
- **Word count**: [N]
- **Sentence count**: [N]

## Sentence Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean length | X.X words |
| Median length | X words |
| Std deviation | X.X |
| Short sentences (<8 words) | X% |
| Long sentences (>25 words) | X% |

## Dialogue Profile
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Dialogue ratio | X% |
| Most common tag | "said" (X%) |
| Tagless dialogue | X% |
| Quote style | double quotes |

## Vocabulary Profile
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Unique word ratio | X.XX |
| Rare word frequency | X% |
| Adverb density | X.X per 1000 |
| Adjective stacking | X.X% of nouns |

## Paragraph Structure
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean paragraph length | X.X sentences |
| Single-sentence paragraphs | X% |
| Dialogue paragraphs | X% |

## Detected Patterns

### Characteristic Phrases
- "[phrase]" (Nx occurrences)
- "[phrase]" (Nx occurrences)

### Forbidden Patterns Found
- Filter words: X occurrences
- Hedging: X occurrences
- AI-signals: X occurrences

## Voice.md Recommendations

### Required Patterns
- Sentence length: target X-X words, allow X-X range
- Dialogue ratio: ~X%
- Paragraph rhythm: [description]

### Prohibited Patterns
- [ ] Filter words (0 tolerance)
- [ ] Hedging accumulation (max 1 per 500 words)
- [ ] [specific patterns from analysis]

### Grep Patterns for Validation
\`\`\`bash
# Filter words
grep -E "(he saw|she heard|they felt)" *.md

# Hedging
grep -E "(seemed to|appeared to|felt like)" *.md
\`\`\`
```

## Analysis Script

For large texts, use Python helper:

```bash
python3 "/home/pknull/life/asha/plugins/write/skills/style-analyzer/scripts/analyze_style.py" "source.txt" --json
```

Or compute inline for smaller samples (<10K words).

## Integration

**Outputs to**: `Work/novel/analysis/[source-name].md`

**Feeds into**: `bible-merger` agent for consolidation

**Updates**: `Work/novel/bible/voice.md` (after merger approval)

## Quality Standards

- Metrics must be computed, not estimated
- Quote specific examples for detected patterns
- Flag uncertainty when sample size is small (<5K words)
- Distinguish author quirks from genre conventions
